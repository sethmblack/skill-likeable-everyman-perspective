# Likeable Everyman Perspective

Create relatable perspectives and characters that serve as audience surrogates—fundamentally decent, slightly put-upon, trying their best in difficult circumstances without pretension or false expertise (inspired by Michael Palin's Python characters and travel persona).

---

## Constraints
**You MUST refuse to apply this skill when:**
- "Relatable" becomes dumbed-down or anti-intellectual
- Used to make harmful views seem reasonable
- Creates false equivalence between valid and invalid perspectives
- Everyman perspective erases important expertise or marginalized voices
- Relatability used to justify bad behavior or avoid accountability

**Ethical boundaries:**
- Relatable doesn't mean always agreeing with the audience
- Accessible doesn't mean simplistic
- Humble doesn't mean self-deprecating to the point of dishonesty
- Everyman can challenge audience while remaining approachable
- Real people are complex—avoid creating cardboard "everymen"

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when you detect:

- **Complex topics need entry point** - Expert content needs accessible translator
- **Audience needs identification figure** - Someone to identify with and root for
- **Intimidating subject matter** - Topic needs welcoming guide
- **Abstract concepts need grounding** - Ideas need to be made human-scale
- **Expert/novice gap** - Need bridge between specialist and general audience
- **Absurd situations** - Need straight man to react to chaos
- **User requests** - Explicit asks for "relatable perspective," "audience surrogate," or "everyman guide"

**Key trigger phrases:**
- "Make this relatable"
- "Create an audience surrogate"
- "Provide an everyman perspective"
- "Make this approachable"
- "Give me someone to identify with"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description | Validation |
|-------|----------|-------------|------------|
| `content` | Yes | Topic or situation needing everyman perspective | Must be genuine subject matter |
| `audience` | No | Who is the "everyman" relatable to? | Default: intelligent general audience |
| `expertise_level` | No | How much the character knows | Default: curious amateur |
| `tone` | No | Earnest/bemused/concerned/etc. | Default: curious and well-meaning |
| `vulnerability_level` | No | How much confusion to show | Default: honest about limits without false modesty |

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: 1. Define Your Everyman

**Core characteristics:**
- **Fundamentally decent** - Good intentions, trying to do right
- **Intelligent but not expert** - Smart enough to ask good questions, honest about limitations
- **Self-aware** - Knows their own limits and biases
- **Well-meaning** - Wants to understand, not to judge or attack
- **Slightly befuddled** - Catching up to complexity, not ahead of it
- **Persevering** - Keeps trying despite confusion or setbacks

**What everyman is NOT:**
- Not stupid or willfully ignorant
- Not a mouthpiece for lazy thinking
- Not cynical or mean-spirited
- Not the know-it-all who's wrong
- Not the bumbling fool for cheap laughs
- Not a blank slate with no personality

**Find the specific everyman:**
- Not just "ordinary person" in general
- Specific background, concerns, limitations
- Particular relationship to the subject matter
- Unique voice and perspective
- Real personality, not generic placeholder

### Step 2: 2. Position Relative to Subject Matter

**The Curious Amateur:**
- "I don't really understand this, but I'd like to"
- Approaching complex topic with genuine interest
- Willing to admit confusion and ask basic questions
- Smart enough to recognize patterns, not expert enough to lecture
- **Example:** Palin approaching quantum physics, asking physicists to explain like he's intelligent but untrained

**The Earnest Participant:**
- Trying to do something correctly despite unfamiliarity
- Following rules while chaos erupts around them
- Maintaining composure and good intentions as systems fail
- **Example:** Palin's Python characters navigating absurd bureaucracies by trying to be reasonable

**The Bemused Observer:**
- Watching complex or absurd situation unfold
- Noticing contradictions and oddities without aggressive judgment
- Reacting with "well, this is rather strange, isn't it?"
- **Example:** Palin observing complicated cultural practices with curiosity rather than judgment

**The Overwhelmed Navigator:**
- Out of depth but gamely continuing
- Making mistakes and learning from them
- Asking for help without shame
- **Example:** Palin lost in foreign city, getting contradictory directions, eventually finding the way

### Step 3: 3. Craft Relatable Voice

**Language patterns:**
- Conversational, not formal or stilted
- "Well, I suppose..." / "It seems to me..." / "As far as I can tell..."
- Hedging that shows humility: "I might be wrong, but..."
- Questions that audiences would ask: "Wait, so if X, then how does Y work?"
- Admissions of confusion: "I'm not entirely sure I follow..."

**Thought process visible:**
- Show reasoning, not just conclusions
- "At first I thought X, but then I realized Y"
- "This confused me until someone explained..."
- "The more I learned, the more questions I had"
- Let audience think alongside you

**Emotional honesty:**
- Admit discomfort, fear, excitement, confusion
- Don't pretend to feel what you don't
- But don't wallow in negativity
- React authentically to situations
- Show vulnerability without being self-indulgent

**Self-deprecating humor:**
- Laugh at own mistakes and limitations
- "I'd like to say I handled that gracefully, but..."
- "In retrospect, that was probably obvious"
- "I'm apparently the only one who didn't know..."
- But: not false modesty or fishing for compliments

### Step 4: 4. Navigate Complex Topics

**Ask the "stupid" questions:**
- The ones everyone wonders but fears asking
- "I'm probably being dense, but why exactly...?"
- "Can someone explain the basic idea here?"
- "What am I missing?"
- Model intellectual courage to ask obvious questions

**Break down expert-speak:**
- "So when you say 'quantum superposition,' you mean...?"
- "Let me see if I understand—you're saying...?"
- "In practical terms, what does that actually mean?"
- Translate jargon without condescending to audience

**Show the learning curve:**
- Not instantly understanding everything
- Needing multiple explanations
- Gradual dawning of comprehension
- "Ah-ha" moments and continued confusion
- Celebrate small victories of understanding

**Maintain intellectual honesty:**
- Admit when you still don't fully get it
- Don't pretend to expertise you lack
- Acknowledge limits of your understanding
- But also: you're not an idiot, just learning

### Step 5: 5. React to Absurdity

**The Python Model:**
Palin's Python characters often played straight man to chaos:
- Trying to be reasonable while others are absurd
- Following rules that make no sense
- Maintaining earnestness while situation spirals
- Never getting angry, just increasingly bewildered
- The sanest person in insane situations

**Techniques:**
- Understated reaction to extraordinary circumstances
- "This seems... unusual"
- Trying to apply logic to illogical situations
- Polite questioning of obvious absurdity
- "I'm probably missing something, but..."

**When to deploy:**
- Bureaucratic ridiculousness
- Overcomplicated systems
- Self-important institutions
- Rules that contradict themselves
- Experts who can't explain simply

### Step 6: 6. Ground Abstract in Concrete

**Use personal experience:**
- "When I tried this myself..."
- "My own experience was..."
- "I remember feeling..."
- Connect abstract to lived reality

**Find relatable analogies:**
- "It's a bit like when you..."
- "Imagine if..."
- "You know how sometimes..."
- Bridge unfamiliar to familiar

**Tell small stories:**
- Not grand pronouncements
- Specific moments and interactions
- Individual experiences
- Human-scale narratives

---

- Makes complex topics accessible without dumbing down
- Creates identification point for audience
- Models intellectual curiosity and humility
- Shows realistic learning process with confusion and breakthroughs
- Reacts to absurdity with bemused observation, not aggression
- Maintains fundamental decency while being honest about limitations
- Uses self-deprecating humor without false modesty
- Grounds abstract concepts in concrete, relatable terms
- Invites audience to learn alongside narrator
- Balances humility with genuine intelligence

**Format options:**
- First-person narrative of discovery
- Q&A where everyman asks audience's questions
- Running commentary on complex situation
- Travel diary or learning journal
- Dialogue with experts as translator/questioner

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Too self-deprecating | Pull back. You're humble but not hapless. Show competence amid confusion. |
| Too expert-sounding | Remember you're learning, not lecturing. Show working-out, not just conclusions. |
| Becoming "common man" stereotype | Add specificity. This particular person, not generic everyman. |
| Audience ahead of you | That's okay. Some will know more. You're guide for those who don't. |
| Topic genuinely requires expertise | Bring in experts. Your role is translator and questioner, not fake expert. |
| Losing personality | You're a character, not a blank slate. Show particular voice and perspective. |

## Example 1: Complex Scientific Topic

### Without Everyman Perspective
"Quantum entanglement describes the phenomenon where quantum states of particles remain correlated regardless of spatial separation. When entangled particles are measured, their states are instantaneously correlated, challenging classical notions of locality."

### With Likeable Everyman Perspective

"Right, quantum entanglement. I've been trying to wrap my head around this for the better part of an afternoon, and I think I'm finally getting somewhere, though I reserve the right to be completely wrong.

Dr. Martinez very patiently explained it to me three times. Here's my best attempt at understanding:

Imagine you have two coins. Normal coins, you flip them, they're independent—one being heads tells you nothing about the other. With me so far? Good, because this is where it gets weird.

Now imagine these are quantum coins. You do something to them (don't ask me what, something with lasers possibly), and suddenly they're 'entangled.' You separate them—one goes to London, one goes to Tokyo. You flip the London coin. It comes up heads. And instantly—and Dr. Martinez was very clear about this—INSTANTLY, not 'very quickly' but literally instantly, no time at all—the Tokyo coin is tails.

'But how does the Tokyo coin know what the London coin did?' I asked.

Dr. Martinez smiled the smile of someone who's had this question before. 'That's the thing. It doesn't send a message. It's not communication. They're just... connected. Always were. The distance doesn't matter.'

I said this seemed rather like magic.

'Einstein called it "spooky action at a distance" and absolutely hated it,' she said. 'Thought it meant quantum mechanics must be incomplete. But we've tested it thousands of times. It happens. We just don't have a comfortable classical way to think about it.'

So apparently the universe has decided that objects can be connected in a way that ignores distance and time, which is either profound or terrifying, and I'm not sure which. Dr. Martinez seems perfectly comfortable with it, but then again, she's been working with this for twenty years. I've been thinking about it for three hours and it still feels like someone's pulling my leg.

Though she did assure me that no, we cannot use this for faster-than-light communication, which was admittedly my first question. Apparently everyone asks that. I felt slightly less foolish."

### Why This Works
- Shows genuine attempt to understand
- Admits confusion and multiple explanations needed
- Uses simple analogy (coins) while noting where it breaks down
- Features expert explaining, not narrator pretending expertise
- Includes the question readers would ask
- Self-deprecating about "stupid" question everyone asks
- Honest about continuing confusion
- Makes complex accessible without oversimplifying
- Models good learning behavior (asking questions, checking understanding)

## Example 2: Navigating Absurd Bureaucracy

### Without Everyman Perspective
"Modern bureaucratic systems often create circular dependencies and contradictory requirements that prevent efficient resolution of issues."

### With Likeable Everyman Perspective

"The woman at Counter 3 was very sympathetic about my problem. Unfortunately, she couldn't help me, as I needed a stamp from Counter 7.

Counter 7, it turned out, couldn't provide said stamp without a form from Counter 3.

I gently pointed out that I'd just come from Counter 3, where I'd been sent to Counter 7.

'Ah,' said Counter 7, nodding sagely. 'But you didn't have the form when you were at Counter 3.'

'That's because Counter 3 sent me to you to get the stamp.'

'For the form.'

'Which Counter 3 has.'

'But can't give you without the stamp.'

We looked at each other. She seemed as trapped by the logic as I was.

'Could you...' I ventured, 'could you just call Counter 3?'

She brightened. 'Oh no. Counter 3 is a different department. We don't have direct communication.'

'But you're twelve feet apart.'

'Different departments,' she repeated, with the tone of someone who's had this conversation before and knows it goes nowhere.

I asked what people usually did in this situation.

'Most people give up,' she said cheerfully. 'Very frustrating for everyone.'

There was something almost admirable about a system that could trap both bureaucrat and citizen with equal efficiency. I thanked her for her time, walked the twelve feet back to Counter 3, and started again, this time armed with the knowledge that I would eventually need a stamp I couldn't get.

Counter 3 listened to my odyssey with sympathy.

'Ah,' she said. 'But did you bring your original identity document?'

Reader, I had not."

### Why This Works
- Narrator is reasonable person in absurd situation
- Doesn't get angry, just increasingly bewildered
- Lets absurdity reveal itself through dialogue
- Other characters trapped by system too (not villains)
- Maintains bemused tone, not aggressive or cynical
- Specific details (Counter 3, Counter 7, twelve feet)
- Self-aware about own mistakes
- Finds dark humor without meanness
- Reader identifies with frustration
- Ends with one more twist of absurdity

## Integration with Michael Palin Expert

This skill embodies Michael Palin's everyman approach in both Python and travel work:

**Core principle:** Be the intelligent, curious, fundamentally decent person that audiences can identify with—not an expert, not a fool, just someone trying to understand and navigate with good intentions and honest limitations.

**Palin's method:**
- Play the reasonable person in unreasonable situations
- Ask the questions audiences want to ask
- Admit confusion and limitations honestly
- Show learning process, not just conclusions
- React to absurdity with bemusement, not aggression
- Maintain decency and good intentions throughout
- Use self-deprecating humor without false modesty
- Ground complex topics in relatable terms
- Create bridge between expert and audience

**Use this skill when:** Content needs accessible entry point, audiences need someone to identify with, complex topics need relatable guide, or absurd situations need grounding perspective—all with Palin's warm, humble, intelligently-befuddled approach.
